Rice Bootcamp Module 12 Assignment: U Vote It

## Introduction

In your ongoing efforts to participate in the local tech community, you've joined a group called U Develop It. This group meets regularly to discuss new developments in web technology. By participating, you can meet peers, collaborators, mentors, and even future employers.

U Develop It is starting a new fiscal year, and it's time to pick a new president. Of course, the group is developing its own app for voting. Some members have already started building the front end of the application, but they need volunteers to build the back end.

The back end will consist of a relational database behind an API. You already know how to create an API with Express.js, so you've volunteered to join the back-end development team. This will be a great opportunity to learn about databases!

The back-end team has settled on using MySQL for the database. As a relational database, it excels at storing and retrieving records that are related to each otherâ€”like candidates, their parties, and members' votes. Like most relational databases, MySQL is queried using Structured Query Language, or SQL. Learning SQL will serve you well in your career because other popular relational databases also use SQL, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. MySQL is a popular database choice for both small and large projects because it is easy to configure, secure, reliable, and open source. It also runs on almost any operating system.
